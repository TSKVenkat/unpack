# Repository Analysis API

The API routes under `src/app/api/repos/` handle the initiation and retrieval of repository analysis data.

- **Analyze Repository (`src/app/api/repos/analyze/route.ts`):** This route's `POST` method is called by the dashboard ([src/app/dashboard/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/dashboard/page.tsx)) to initiate the analysis of a new GitHub repository. It likely takes the repository URL as input and starts an asynchronous analysis process.
- **Fetch Analysis Details (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/route.ts`):** The `GET` method of this dynamic route is used by the analysis detail page ([src/app/analysis/[analysisId]/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/analysis/[analysisId]/page.tsx)) to fetch the complete analysis data for a specific `analysisId`. It returns the summary, features, architecture, and code statistics.
- **Analysis Status (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/status/route.ts`):** This route likely provides updates on the progress of an ongoing analysis.
- **Analysis Export (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/export/route.ts`):** This route handles the export functionality for analysis results.
- **Architecture Details (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/architecture/route.ts`):** Provides specific architecture details for an analysis.
- **Features Details (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/features/route.ts`):** Provides specific features details for an analysis.
- **Summary Details (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/summary/route.ts`):** Provides the summary for an analysis.
- **Directory and File Details (`src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/directory/route.ts`, `src/app/api/repos/[analysisId]/file/route.ts`):** These routes likely provide detailed information about specific directories and files within an analyzed repository.

These API routes interact with the backend logic to perform the analysis, store results, and retrieve them based on the provided `analysisId`.
